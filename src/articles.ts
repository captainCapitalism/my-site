        teahouse POS system:
        Purpose: To abandon Excel sheet as a way to store orders and to create solution that will make harder for users to make a mistake.
        Stack:
    html/css + vanilla.js
    node.js/express
    mongoDB
        Result:
    Solution was complete and functional and beside starting functionality of storing orders I enhanced it by weekly ToDo list for employees, reservation system, archive and statistics for items ordered.
        
    Takeaway:
        I have learnt how to split big idea into digestible chunks that can be realized during short periods of time, iterate through a product by allowing it to scale by developing new features. 
        Solution nowadays does not satisfy me so I am refactoring it because I got better grasp on how to plan and modularize code and I have learnt new technics that I am eager to try. 
        Attempt could be find here. My plan is to use again express and mongoDB on backend and try to program in TDD methodology with mocha/chai testing framework. Backend shall be separated from Frontend so I would like to finish before creating UI. For frontend I am going to use React/Redux hopefully with TDD as well.`

        Purpose: 
            My Spotify saved albums exceeded count of 300 and proved difficulties while finding music I would like to listen. Native playlist were not really sufficient for me and feature of grouping albums into folders was promised to not be made by Spotify Support.
        
        
        Stack:
            React + Redux
            SpotifyAPI as backend
            JSON as storage
        
        Result:
            User is able to create a folder inside which is basic data about selected albums. Clicking album cover redirects to Spotify web player (or desktop app if user agreed in appâ€™s settings to do so). One can assign album to multiple folders so they can act also as tags.
        
        
        Takeaway:
            I have learnt how to use Spotify Dev API and how to use Redux patterns with React. I have decided to not use class-based React components but functional components and hooks for updates and managing local state.
